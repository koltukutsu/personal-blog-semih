## Architecture

### Pure components

Every stateless pure component is found under `./components`.

Every component that has to do with styling the post's markup
is found under `./components/post/`

These components make up the _style guide_ of the application.

### Thought posts

Every thought post is a static page hosted under `pages/$year/`.

This allows every post to load arbitrary modules, have custom layouts
and take advantage of automatic code splitting and lazy loading.

This means that the bloat of a single post doesn't "rub off on" the
rest of the site.

An index of all posts is maintained in JSON format as `./posts.json`
for practical reasons.
