Mehmet Semih Babacan is a deep-tech founder, ex-CEO, and full-stack engineer with dual degrees in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering. As the co-founder and CEO of Solace Technology, he built and launched two AI-native products: Ensi (a smart home assistant) and EMA (a conversational sales agent for B2B). He led all aspects of the business—engineering, product, go-to-market, and team scaling.

Semih thrives in fast-moving, build-from-zero environments. He combines systems thinking, AI/ML integration, and rapid prototyping to turn ideas into scalable, user-centric software. His stack spans Python, React, LangChain, Node.js, and Flutter, and he brings strong leadership and cross-functional execution across product and growth.

He’s a generalist who gets things done—whether it's writing core infrastructure, designing user onboarding, or pitching to investors.
